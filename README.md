# Final-Project

TalkingData, China’s largest third-party mobile data platform, understands that everyday choices and behaviors paint a picture of who we are and what we value. Currently, TalkingData is seeking to leverage behavioral data from more than 70% of the 500 million mobile devices active daily in China to help its clients better understand and interact with their audiences. TalkingData wanted to use their data to help its clients better understand and interact with their individual respective audiences.

The goal of this project is to analyze the users’ demographic characteristics, based on their app usage, geolocation and mobile device properties to build a model to predict and identify the 12 different age groups in the data set accurately.

Also there are three main hypothesises in this project that investigated to see wether we should accept or reject them.

Exploratory data analysis, data processing & feature engineering, supervised and unsupervised learning models and deep learning were implemented in this project.
